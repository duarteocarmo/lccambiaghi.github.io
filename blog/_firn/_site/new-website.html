I have attempted several times at creating one.
The first function a personal website should serve is showcase your achievements, e.g. your former experience and projects.
The second function I have always seeked from my website is technical blogging.
Moreover, I wanted my website to be hosted for free, without any limitations.</span></p><p><span>In regards to blogging, I wanted to do it in the simplest way. Not too simple though, as Einstein said:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Everything should be made as simple as possible,
but not any simpler ---Albert Einstein</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In my previous attempts at building a website I never reached that sweet spot: things were either too complex or too simple.
In this blog post I explain what brought me to this point.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="previous-approaches"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Previous approaches</span></span></h1><section><p><span>A popular approach is to host a static website on Github Pages with Ruby+Jekyll.
Github recently made this very easy with the </span><a class="firn-external" href="https://github.com/github/personal-website" target="_blank">personal website project</a><span>.
I tried twice that approach because of how easy and fast it is to set up.</span></p><p><span>The first time I set up a simple website was few years ago and I did it with a minimal Jekyll template to showcase my github projects and my skills.
I had a page where I could easily write blog posts in </span><code>.md</code><span> files, placing the posts in a certain folder structure with a certain filename.
Simple enough, right? Maybe too simple. I could not easily control the website template. I had to write my posts in </span><code>markdown</code><span> files.
I quickly lost interest in the website and never blogged once.</span></p><p><span>The second time around was at the beginning of 2020, shortly after discovering Emacs.
I saw a beautiful blog online and made it a day's quest to replicate it on my </span><code>gh-pages</code><span> branch.
What the author was using was an R library called </span><code>rmarkdown</code><span>, which under the hood uses </span><code>knitr</code><span> + </span><code>pandoc</code><span> to render </span><code>.Rmd</code><span> files.
The final touch I added was so I could write posts using my favourite markup language, i.e. Org Mode.
I could write </span><code>.org</code><span> files, export them to </span><code>.Rmd</code><span> files and finally render them with </span><code>rmarkdown</code><span>.
The website's style was stunning also! Very easy to steal some CSS from his website.</span></p><p><span>I could blog writing </span><code>.org</code><span> files and I had a beautiful website.. Still I never blogged once. Maybe it was not simple enough.
The setup must have been working very well for its original author, a Data Scientist writing a lot of </span><code>.Rmd</code><span> analyses. Not so much for me.</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="this-approach-:clojurescript-org-mode:"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>This approach :clojurescript org-mode:</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Lately I have been very fascinated by the Clojure programming language. I will write a post in the future about it.
In the websites I am lurking, the community often speaks about Clojurescript which can compile to Javascript code.
Some of the </span><code>cljs</code><span> frameworks for simple-page applications seem simple and elegant (like most things Clojure related).</span></p><p><span>Today I found a minimal, beautiful blog set up with </span><code>shadow-cljs</code><span>, which had very little code, all of which was understandable enough.
It looks like the author is a </span><code>js</code><span> and </span><code>cljs</code><span> developer, so it has been interesting to learn some best practices since I have absolutely zero knowledge of frontend development.</span></p><p><span>Well, I forked his repo and it was extremely quick to build the website locally and deploy it to netlify!
New concepts I need to understand more:</span></p><ul><li><p><code>yarn</code><span> > </span><code>npm</code><span> for managing dependencies, building and releasing</span></p></li><li><p><code>tailwind</code><span> + </span><code>postcss</code><span> for easy customization of your website's style</span></p></li><li><p><code>yarn shadow-cljs watch app</code><span> to develop while hot-reloading the website a-la-figwheel</span></p></li><li><p><span>Connecting to the </span><code>clojurescript</code><span> REPL to interact with the browser</span></p></li></ul><p><span>This is a very exciting environment to develop my website and customize it to my liking! No more deciphering templates and stealing off CSS, I will customize it how I want.</span></p><p><span>The second news, even more exciting, is that the author wrote a simple logic to parse </span><code>.md</code><span> and populate the website.
This means that to write my blog posts I can write with Org Mode and easily export to </span><code>.md</code><span>.
I will also adopt the approach used in </span><code>ox-hugo</code><span>, that is to have a single </span><code>.org</code><span> file and have posts live under a heading.
I can then export a single post with </span><code>,e C-s mm</code><span>, i.e. calling </span><code>org-export-dispatch</code><span>, narrowing the scope to the subtree and exporting to a markdown file.</span></p><p><span>I really like having the full control over the website. Deploying to netlify means that I am not limited to what Github Pages lets me do.
In the future I would like to explore different things, like embedding an interactive </span><code>D3</code><span> visualization or a </span><code>vega-lite</code><span> SVG.
I am happy to </span><strong><span>need</span></strong><span> to understand the details for these integrations instead of resorting to a magical plugin in an obscure template (like with </span><code>hugo</code><span>).</span></p></section></div><div class="firn-headline-section firn-headline-section-1"><h1 class="firn-headline firn-headline-1" id="why-blogging?"><span class="firn-headline-text"><span>Why blogging?</span></span></h1><section><p><span>Technical blogging is a great opportunity to learn how to explain something you </span><u><span>think</span></u><span> you know something about and how to organise your thoughts.
Before writing this post I thought I had a clear idea of what to write but at the end of the post I can see that I digressed and I could have benefitted from organizing the structure of the post beforehand.
It's okay since it is my first post, but see? Already learning!</span></p><p><span>In the future I plan to write about the things I deem interesting that I am exploring.
I do this for self documentation and to maybe help a fellow user who might come across the same problem I was solving and maybe it will help him save some time.
I will adjust with time around a certain size and type of content. I expect the two main categories will be data science and software engineering tooling.</span></p></section></div></div></div></article></main></body></html>
