Step 5: Editing The Files

Open up "Packages", "Release" and "index.html" and edit to your preference. Inside of index.html you should see a part with ((CHANGE TO YOUR REPO)), just use the same repo as you used prior, ie; username.github.io(remove brackets)

Step 6: Add Tweak Debian

Adding the debian is simply placing your tweak debian(.deb) into the debs folder, 

WARNING: Make sure you edit the .deb name to be the same as "Filename" inside of Packages

Step 7: Compress and Compile

Open or go back to your terminal prompt and cd back into your /var/mobile/username.github.io folder.

bzip2 -z Packages

git add --all

git commit -m "Init"

git push
