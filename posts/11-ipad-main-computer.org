* Introduction
I am in between jobs.
I had to return my Mac to my previous employer and I will get one from my next employer in a couple of months.
This gave me an excuse to try different workflows.

I think that in order to get creative, we must try different tools.

So I bought a second-hand 12.9" iPad Pro. It is the 3rd generation (2018), so it has FaceID and no home button (nice full-screen layout).
It has 4GB of RAM and a A12X 8-core CPU (4 low power cores and 4 normal cores). 
It has an ARM64e architecture, the same as the praised M1 chips which recently came out.

It has USB-C instead of lightning. This means I can just use my USB-C adapter and connect to my keyboard and monitor with HDMI.
When I connected it for the first time and tried to use it "docked" it was the first *WOW* moment.

Ok, what next? I came up with a bunch of challenging tasks, if the iPad could solve them all then I would admit it could be my main machine:
1. ~emacs~ (org mode, magit, TRAMP, ...)
2. Python development (jupyter notebooks, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels)
3. Clojure development in Emacs (requires number 1)
4. Blog writing in Emacs (requires number 1)
5. Run a linux VM (docker, nix, ...)
6. Version control

Then some other "leisure" tasks, which would make it a pretty cool personal device:
1. Cloud gaming (with PS4 joystick)
2. Streaming files to Chromecast
3. Taking digital persistent notes (with Apple Pencil 2)

After about one month of experiments, I can say I succeeded in all of these tasks and that makes the iPad Pro a pretty damn versatile tool.
To run ~emacs~ you will need your iPad to be jailbreakable, which at the moment of writing means being on iOS14.3 or lower.

To do all the rest you only need Safari and iOS apps. Technology has gone that far!

* Blink Shell
The very first thing you should know about is Blink Shell.
It is IMHO the best terminal app on the iOS App Store.
Some of my favourite features are:
- Support of iOS "windows", which means essentially ability to split full screen app in 2 or more "windows"
- Support of second monitor, so one window is on the iPad and the other in the monitor
- [[https://mosh.org][Mosh]] protocol, which is a more robust SSH with slow connections

It is quite pricey if you purchase it from the store but you can also build your ~.ipa~ with XCode on your Mac and then install it on your iOS device for free through XCode. You can follow the tutorial [[https://github.com/blinksh/blink][on github]].

You will need to turn your Apple ID in a Developer Apple ID, which you can do for free.
Try to look at [[https://developer.apple.com/programs/][this Apple page]].
With your Dev Apple ID you can sign up to 3 apps but you have to re-sign them every 7 days.
There exist some tools like AltStore ([[https://altstore.io][link]]) which resign them automatically for you.

If your device is jailbroken you can install a tweak called AppSync Unified (here a [[https://cydia.akemi.ai/?page/net.angelxwind.appsyncunified][link]]).
This tweak allows you to install any valid signed IPA and it will not expire after 7 days.
You can use another tweak called Filza File Manager (here a [[http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.tigisoftware.filza/][link]]), click on the ~.ipa~ you built and install it.
You can send the ~.ipa~ from your Mac to your iPad with AirDrop for instance and from the Files app you can open with Filza (through the Share menu).

Once you have Blink, you will want to configure it so for that you run the ~config~ command.
From here you can add hosts to which you SSH/MOSH into.
You can also generate keys through Blink.
After setting them up you can just execute ~ssh host~...

... which brings me to my next section.

* Google Cloud Platform
With the power of a good (free) terminal emulator and SSH, if you "live in your terminal" you might as well have reached happiness.
Especially because I have discovered that for the "simple" needs (like my experiments) you don't need to pay crazy amounts of money for a VM.

I signed up for the Google Cloud Platform trial period and I was awared 300$ of credit to try products.
The most obvious product to try out in this setting is Google Compute Engine (GCE), where you can spin up a VM.
It is very easy, you can configure CPU and RAM according to your requirements.
Once you have your VM, you can just SSH from Blink and you are back to your comfort zone.

There is another Google Cloud feature I discovered, Google Cloud Shell.
When you are in the Google Cloud console, you can just click on the "terminal" icon on the top right.
It will "provision your Google Cloud Shell machine" for you and once loaded you have a shell running in your browser, connected to a small VM (I believe 1.7GB RAM, 0.2 CPU and 5GB of storage, BUT STILL!).

In the same bottom window you can tap/click on "Open Editor" and that will open a new window with the Theia web editor:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<img src="../static/img/theia-screenshot.png" alt="Theia cloud editor" style="width: 100%;" />
#+END_EXPORT

Theia is quite similar to VSCode so now we are coding in our browser, for free.
It comes pre-installed with Python, Go, Java and others.
You can also install most UNIX tools.

It comes with 5GB of storage if you save data in your ~$HOME~ directory.
They even have a "Boost Mode" which will give you a better CPU and 3.4GB of RAM.
This mode has reasonable monthly limits so you can enable it when you need it.

* code-server
If you find the Theia editor is a bit limited for your use case you can even run "proper VSCode" thanks to the [[https://github.com/cdr/code-server][code-server project]]. 
Proper VSCode means it is the same UI and you can install (most) extensions.

In the Google Cloud Shell you can install it with:
#+begin_src shell
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- --method=standalone
#+end_src

Then we need to configure it. First we run:
#+begin_src shell
sudo chown USERNAME .local/share/code-server
#+end_src

And write to ~~/.config/code-server/config.yml~:
#+begin_src yaml
bind-addr: 127.0.0.1:5000
auth: none
cert: false
#+end_src

And finally you can start the server with ~code-server~.
Then you just "click" on the address in the output of the command and that will open a new tab with VSCode running in your browser, for free.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<img src="../static/img/code-server-screenshot.png" alt="code-server running on Cloud Shell" style="width: 100%;" />
#+END_EXPORT

You can install ~code-server~ on any GCE VM, you just need to create a firewall rule: Firewall -> New firewall rule -> 0.0.0.0/0 -> tcp, 5000, allow.
You might need to change the command to ~code-server --host 0.0.0.0~.

* iOS apps for local Python development
Alright, cloud development is fun.
What if we are without internet?
What can we do anything with this device's resources?

As mentioned in the Introduction, it has an 8-core CPU and 4GB of RAM.
As it turns out, smart people have developed cool iOS apps which let you do Python development on device.

This sounds obvious but it is actually quite hard.
Since apps in iOS are sandboxed, they cannot access any command line tool so devs have to package a python interpreter AND associated modules in the app.
If you want to use ~numpy~ and friends you will need to package a C compiler, if you want to use ~scipy~ a Fortran compiler as well.

There are two projects I want to highlight.
They are both open source on Github, which is amazing.

** Jupyter Notebooks
The first is Carnets ([[https://apps.apple.com/it/app/carnets-jupyter-with-scipy/id1559497253?l=en][App Store link]]), which is a fully functioning Jupyter Notebook frontend.
It is packaged with all C and Fortran dependencies you need and it is completely free.
Props to the amazing developer Nicholas Holzschuch.

By the way, he is also the developer of another incredible app called a-Shell ([[https://apps.apple.com/it/app/a-shell/id1473805438?l=en][App Store link]]), which packages Python, ~vim~ (!), ~git~ (!!!) ~LaTeX~ (!!!!) and others.

Another interesting Jupyter Notebook option (however here we go back to the "cloud" situation) is [[https://gradient.paperspace.com][Paperspace Gradient]], which gives you a nice browser environment and free GPU.
Google Colab is a similat alternative.
I like Carnets because it has the familiar Jupyter Notebook UI and keyboard shortcuts, so I am productive from minute 1.

** Scripting and project
The second app I want to recommend is called Pyto ([[https://apps.apple.com/it/app/pyto-python-3/id1436650069?l=en][App Store link]]) and it is a fully functioning IDE.
You can navigate a Python project's codebase, execute scripts, DEBUG them!

It also comes packaged with the data science dependencies you need and you can ~pip install~ pure Python packages (e.g. ~joblib~).

Pyto has a 3 days trial after which you are prompted for an in-app purchase.
I personally did not purchase it because I have access to a better IDE.
Depending on your needs, you may want to purchase it.

* Jailbreak tweaks and Procursus bootstrap
We have come to the more advanced section of the article.
I bought the iPad without expecting to jailbreak it.
I was lucky and got it on iOS 14.2, for which a stable jailbreak had been released.

I have been out of the JB scene for a while, my latest "serious" attempt at jailbreak was when I purchased my iPhone X. 
I checked its serial number to be sure it came out with a jailbreakable iOS version.
That was iOS 11.
The most annoying part of the jailbreak is that some apps have JB detection and when I could not bypass them I just gave it up.

Having it on the iPad made a lot of sense for this experiment, to see "what more it gives".
For the uninitiated, JB allows you to install extensions (called tweaks) which can:
- Modify/toggle iOS system features (e.g. enable App Library on iPadOS14 or enable SplitView for all apps)
- Modify iOS apps (e.g. remove ads from YouTube)
- Add new features (e.g. full access to filesystem and Darwin tooling)

Tweak development is done in C++ with a tool called ~theos~ ([[https://iphonedev.wiki/index.php/Theos/Setup][tutorial to set it up]]).
To develop tweaks you need to learn about iOS Reverse Engineering.
Tweaks "hook" into iOS methods and extend/override them.

You then compile tweaks into ~.deb~ files, which are distrbuted with ~APT~ repositories.
Users install tweaks with package managers (which are ~dpkg~ frontends), such as the popular Cydia or the newer Sileo.

I jailbroke with [[https://taurine.app/][Taurine]] and while getting up to speed with the JB scene I stumbled upon a community of very smart (and young!) developers with an amazing project: port the useful UNIX toolchain to the iOS universe.

The project is called Procursus ([[https://github.com/ProcursusTeam/Procursus][github]]) and it is a collection of Makefiles which compile tools like ~git~, ~clang~, ~cmake~, ... into ~.deb~ files which can be installed on your iOS device.
Amazing.

You can install ~openSSH~ and SSH into ~localhost~ (with Blink for example).
You can then run whatever CLI tool you installed with Procursus.
Ported tooling is growing by the day and the community is super helpful.
I requested Emacs and an amazing developer just compiled a ~.deb~ for me and shared it on Github.

* Emacs on iPad
So we come to the final section: Emacs on iPad.
The very first challenging task I listed in the Introduction.

I am currently writing my blog from my iPad, with ~emacs~ and ~org-mode~.
That was challenge number 4 on my list.
I just run ~emacs --script publish.el~ and preview the HTML files with Filza, the file manager that every iOS user deserves.

The Procursus repo has ~openjdk~ and ~openjre~ so this morning I simply installed ~clojure~ following the install instructions.
I could run it from ~org-mode~ with org-babel without setup.
I am happy I am now starting to get a return on the investment of learning ~emacs~.
I have achieved good portability and composability of my tools.

Not everything is gold, though: one issue I have is that the packaged ~emacs~ is the terminal version (which I had never used before).
There is some incompatibility with ~xterm~ so I only have 8 colors.
I had to spend some time tweaking a theme, which made me realize I don't NEED so many colors.

#+BEGIN_EXPORT html
<img src="../static/img/emacs-on-ipad.png" alt="Theia cloud editor" style="width: 100%;" />
#+END_EXPORT

I also adapted my ~.emacs~ to behave differently if I am on iPadOS.
This is useful because there are some modules of my configuration which I know I will not run.
To see my configuration just click on the "emacs" link in the top right of this blog (obviously now the config is redacted, version controlled and rendered from my main computer: the iPad).

* iOS advanced features
My final section will be about some advanced features I discovered in iPadOS with time.
I think mastering these is absolutely necessary if you want to be productive with this device.

The first step is getting familiar with iPadOS multitasking.
You start by running an app in full screen (e.g. Blink with an ~emacs~ instance running).
You then invoke Spotlight (CMD+space) and write Safari.
You then drag and drop the icon to the right.

The first option is SplitView, by which the screen is vertically split in two "windows".
The second option is SlideOver, where Safari takes a third of the screen and "overlays" the full screen app.
You can then "swipe away" the SlideOver app to the right, continue working, "swipe it in" again from the right to check another website.

You can open multiple apps in Slideover, let's say for example you also drag Mail to the SlideOver location.
If you then drag from the bottom of the app, hold for a sec and release (the gesture to invoke multitasking) you have access to both apps in SlideOver.
You can close the ones you don't need anymore.

Sorry for not posting screenshots, there are already many great resources to learn iPadOS features.
I recommend [[https://www.macstories.net/stories/beyond-the-tablet/7/][this MacStories article]] for example.

To be frank, I hate that you have to drag and drop to control multitasking.
iOS15 will improve this by providing more keyboard shortcuts so that you don't have to touch the screen at all.
I am currently looking into a tweak called ~zxtouch~ ([[https://github.com/xuan32546/IOS13-SimulateTouch][here Github link]]) which can simulate touch events so I plan to record this touch interactions and play them with a keyboard key.

I will close the section with a very hidden feature of iOS which is supposed to help control the iPad with the keyboard.
This is called Full Keyboard Access and you can access it with Settings -> Accessibility -> Keyboard.
When you enable it, you can navigate all iOS menus (e.g. Settings) with the keyboard.

You navigate with arrows, tap with space.
You have access to common gestures with the TAB prefix, for example TAB+A invokes the app switcher.
My experience with FKA has been a bit lacking though, what I really need are the shortcuts for multitasking.
Maybe some tweak developer can port the iOS15 keyboard shortcuts.

* Conclusion
Wow, it has been quite a long article, thank you for following to the end!
In conclusion this iPad is an amazing device and it can do most if not all of what I need for personal projects.
It can also do more things than what my Mac could not do.

I can draw and take notes with Apple Pencil.
I can play iOS games not available for macOS, as well as iOS apps which offer advantages over web apps (e.g. Netflix allowing offline downloads).

This being said, I will get a Mac from my next employer and I will use it over the iPad every day.
Working from an actual laptop is just more efficient, in particular multitasking and window tiling software (I use Amethyst).
I would also hit the limit of 4GB of RAM all the time when doing serious python development.

Nonetheless, I think I have demonstrated that an iPad is more than enough for personal projects.
This "cloud" movement is exciting and I believe it is the future.
